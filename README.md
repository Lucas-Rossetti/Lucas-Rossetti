- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucas-Rossetti
- 👀 I’m interested in cats and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be happier
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FOSS projects
- 📫 Reach through my email: lucas.rossetti@mailfence.com
- I'm a brazillian programmer. I really like to program and create my little programs
- I think people deserve privacy, so all my programs are FOSS and do not track(unless I NEED to track in order for the program to work) any user
- Always trying to improve!

$ python3 oracle(not the corp).py 'what is the most important thing cats and dogs tought us?'
Love is what matters, and not the kind
Adopt, do not shop
